Welcome to the gradle_build_automation wiki!

What drove me to this?

So, I work on a Mac. Yeah sounds fancy, well, it is. But there is this one issue when doing builds of Android on Mac OS. What it is? This [SO link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39611889/why-is-apk-generated-by-studio-smaller-than-command-line-apk) will help you instead of me describing this one problem (I type less. Lazy programmer!)

Now you will tell me, hey, you just have to fire 2 commands! Are you that lazy? Yes I am 😜
Well there were other problems too!

**1. Switching between projects:**
We have multiple projects which we work on at a time. When It comes to Android, we have multiple build variants associated with each project. Then again we have different environments of the project. This sums up to generating complex names of build variants and not all projects will have same names of build variants or same environments.
So, when switching between projects it is confusing which build to choose 😥 😓 (it takes a bit of thinking)

**2. Dependency on developer:**
*When leaving office at EOD* "Hey developer! you know the commands, please give me production build of this project.", says the manager. Well not any more. He has access to the repo and your CLI tool. 😊 peace ✌🏽

**3. Typos when typing commands:**
We are developers. Typos are in our DNA. But that's not an excuse when typing commands.. type that command again! 😒😏 Okay!


I am sure after all this you will not need anything more to agree upon! 😊
